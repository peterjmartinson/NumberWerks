Pumps out information on a number

This app takes any (reasonable) number as input, then displays various information about it.
Currently, it determines whether the number is prime, and if not displays its prime factorization.
It also calculates its square and its cube, determines whether it is, itself, a square or cube,
and tests whether it is a triangular number.  It represents my early experience with JavaScript.
